Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from HW5 and why 
those changes were made below.  (See the HW6 assignment for details.)

1. Changing from two sets to map in Graph
I realized that having two sets, one for the nodes id and the other for the node itself was
essentially a map, so I changed my implementation of Graph into a map of node ids to the nodes
themselves.

2. Completely gutted Graph because parsing and making the graph took too long
Rather than having Graph, GraphNode, and Edge be three separate classes, I just made Graph work as
one class. In addition, I used maps and sets extensively in order to speed up performance. Most 
importantly, I took out irrelevant methods, like remove. 

3. Redefining what a node was 
To improve performance, nodes would be identified by their String ids only. The nodes edges would
mapped to it using a map.
